# Multipeer-Voice-Chat

This app uses Apple's `MultipeerConnectivity` and `AVFoundation` frameworks to facilitate area-local peer-to-peer voice calls with up to eight users.

This app is not yet finished, but its core functionality is present. There is only one major known issue -- hitting the `End Call` button in the `InCallViewController`.

I plan to change the layout of the app significantly to improve usability.
